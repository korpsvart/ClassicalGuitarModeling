# ClassicalGuitarModeling


# Folder and files organization

- ```models``` folder contains the COMSOL ```mph``` model files and the associated 3D models. Each subfolder contains a COMSOL ```mph``` file and the 3D designs that can be imported and simulated directly in that COMSOL project without needing additional changes.
    - ```base``` is the folder for the reference COMSOL project for simulating the complete guitar (with neck and air included). The associated folder contains geometrical variation of the top plate bars.
    - ```ribs_thickness``` contains the simulation files for a model where the ribs thickness is increased by 10%.
    - ```wider_body``` contains the simulation files for a model where the guitar body width (neck excluded) has been increased by various amounts.
